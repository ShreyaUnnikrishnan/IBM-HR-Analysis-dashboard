**IBM’s Human Resource Dashboard**

IBM's compensation hikes, diversity, work-life balance, and pay are analyzed in this dashboard. The
dashboard is expected to identify opportunities for improvement after IBM's HR practices were
scrutinized and protested. The dashboard will provide leadership with practical insights on how to
use data findings.

**Element 1: Gender Diversity**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feb0159b-12bc-488f-920f-a9dbec7081c3)

The authorities can take proactive measures to increase gender diversity. First, they can analyze gender imbalance causes. This investigation may examine recruitment and selection processes, unconscious
prejudices, and career progression prospects for women in the organization. We can target these gaps by recognizing them and also promoting female hires. This can involve aggressively finding diverse individuals, promoting gender-neutral job descriptions, and
partnering with women-focused organizations and universities. Mentorship and sponsorship programs can help women advance their careers by providing assistance, networking, and access to senior leaders.
Gender diversity requires inclusive workplaces. Diversity and inclusion training can help employees
become more inclusive by raising awareness of unconscious prejudices. Employee resource groups
or affinity networks for women can help women network, support, and share experiences. We can
also emphasize workplace flexibility. Flexible work hours, remote work, and family-friendly policies
might help retain female talent, especially those juggling work and caring.
Finally, we should set gender diversity goals and track progress. Transparency and accountability will
help the company achieve gender diversity goals.

**Element 2: Department-average age**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc82518a-fbde-440a-ad5a-6e2fd3d3bc61)

IBM HR professionals must examine each department's average age to ensure a diverse and
inclusive workforce. By analyzing the data, we can learn about our teams' ages and find areas for
improvement. IBM's staff includes many seasoned experts of all ages. In the Research and
Development department, the average staff age is 42, reflecting the depth of knowledge and vast
expertise in technical innovation. Design and User Experience departments, on the other hand, have
a younger average age of 31.
From an HR perspective, a good mix of experienced and new hires is crucial. We can use the
strengths of both age groups by encouraging knowledge transfer and mentorship programs, where
older staff can teach younger ones. To attract and retain young talent, engage with universities and
offer internships or entry-level roles. While recognizing and retaining experienced employees,
efforts can be introduced to assist career advancement and retention.
By carefully managing age diversity in each department, we can create a dynamic and creative
atmosphere that benefits from a range of viewpoints, experiences, and ideas. IBM's commitment to
fostering an inclusive workplace where all workers may thrive and contribute to the company's
success includes age diversity.

**Element 3: Growth of wages**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd6a7229-349b-42eb-87fa-d530f57c11a9)

To achieve equitable compensation and recruit and retain top people, we must examine the average
wage increment. IBM's merit-based wage increase scheme considers performance, contribution, and
market considerations. IBM employees receive 2% to 4% wage increases annually. It's vital to
understand that wage rises rely on individual performance, job position, geographic region, and
market conditions. IBM rewards employee performance. Performance reviews and evaluations are
done routinely to analyze staff contributions. As part of IBM's incentive and recognition programs,
strong performers may get pay raises, promotions, or bonuses.
IBM also acknowledges the importance of market competitiveness in attracting and keeping
qualified individuals. Considering job market trends, industry norms, and geographical differences,
the organization aims to offer competitive salary packages.
We must ensure salary raise transparency and fairness as HR professionals. We set clear
performance standards, provide feedback, and discuss compensation issues with staff. We make
wage modifications based on market benchmarking and analysis to be competitive in the talent
market. IBM strives to develop a compensation structure that recognizes and rewards workers,
contributions, promotes performance, and supports the company's success by regularly monitoring
and assessing salary hikes.

**Element 4: Work-life balance**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0a0d998-84a5-4777-b31e-75c2be17fff4)

To enhance employee well-being and satisfaction, IBM HR professionals have prioritized work-life
balance. IBM values work-life balance. The company has several work-life balance rules. IBM offers
remote work and flexible scheduling to satisfy varied employee needs. This helps people balance
work and life. IBM also encourages managers and teams to set clear work-life boundaries,
promoting rest and rejuvenation.
HR can add to work-life balance. For instance, stress management, mindfulness, and well-being
programs can help employees with work pressures. Encouraging employees to take vacations and
granting sabbaticals or personal days can also enhance work-life balance. Employee-HR
communication and feedback can identify areas for development and adjust work-life balance
programs to unique requirements. HR may improve work-life balance programs by surveying or
focusing on employee happiness.
Fostering a supportive and inclusive workplace culture helps promote work-life balance. HR can host
workshops or training sessions to teach employees and managers about work-life balance and how
to foster it. Encouraging open discussions regarding work-life integration and providing guidance on
handling competing demands can enable people to find a balance. HR can ensure that IBM values
employee well-being and work-life harmony by regularly analyzing and adapting work-life balance
programs. Work-life balance promotes employee satisfaction, productivity, engagement, and
organisational success.

**Element 5: Department and job role**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87cc9c25-a160-4bcb-8828-6d9f6d910db6)

Understanding IBM's staff distribution by department and job description is essential for
workforce management and resource allocation. IBM's diversified staff across departments
contributes to its success. HR can spot imbalances and places for improvement by analyzing data.
For instance, if some departments have a disproportionately large number of personnel,
restructuring or resource reallocation may be needed to maximize efficiency and productivity. HR
can also help managers fill employment gaps by recruiting, training, or promoting internal mobility.

HR can use department-specific and job-specific tactics to enhance. To retain and engage high-staff
departments, HR might emphasize on career development and clear growth tracks. Training,
mentoring, and succession planning can help people thrive in their departments. HR can recruit
diverse candidates for underrepresented departments or jobs. Partnering with specialized
recruitment firms, attending industry-specific job fairs, or using online platforms helps expand the
candidate pool. HR may also ensure job descriptions and requirements are inclusive and match the
skills and certifications needed for success.

Cross-functional collaboration can also boost employee engagement and resource allocation.
Knowledge-sharing meetings, project rotations, and work shadowing can help employees learn
about other departments and jobs. This encourages teamwork and helps employees learn new skills.
HR can use workforce distribution monitoring and manager and employee input to make decisions.
HR can guarantee that the organization's resources are allocated properly by keeping open
communication channels and responding to the needs of diverse departments and job functions.

**Element 6: Designation with gender**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d85154e-2a32-4f5f-b8a5-d53d3a12ede6)

To promote equity and an inclusive workplace, we must investigate gender designation distribution.
We can identify gender inequalities in different employment roles and take action by analyzing the
data. IBM has made progress in gender diversity across job roles. Women have increased in
technological positions like software engineering and data science. However, leadership and
executive roles are still underrepresented by women. We can emphasize diversity and fairness in
hiring and appraisal. Diverse sourcing, job descriptions, and interview panels can help attract and
choose more individuals.

We can use succession planning and talent management to identify and develop high-potential
female leaders to solve gender gaps in leadership. Leadership development programs, senior
executive mentoring, and targeted sponsorship can assist build diverse leaders. Monitoring and
reporting gender representation in job titles can help HR identify areas for development and
evaluate diversity and inclusion efforts. HR can improve gender representation across all IBM
designations by setting targets, establishing accountability, and promoting diversity and equitable
opportunities.

**Conclusion**

Implementing this comprehensive dashboard can provide valuable insights to IBM's upper
management, enabling them to make informed strategic and HR decisions. With a range of filters
available, the leadership can analyze data at various levels, from specific subgroups to IBM's overall
operations. This dashboard is an essential tool for aligning operations with IBM's overall strategy and
commitments.
