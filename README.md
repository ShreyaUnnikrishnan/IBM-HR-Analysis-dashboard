IBM’s Human Resource Dashboard

IBM's compensation hikes, diversity, work-life balance, and pay are analyzed in this dashboard. The
dashboard is expected to identify opportunities for improvement after IBM's HR practices were
scrutinized and protested. The dashboard will provide leadership with practical insights on how to
use data findings.

Element 1: Gender Diversity

The authorities can take proactive measures to increase gender diversity. First, they can analyze gender imbalance causes. This investigation may examine recruitment and selection processes, unconscious
prejudices, and career progression prospects for women in the organization. We can target these gaps by recognizing them and also promoting female hires. This can involve aggressively finding diverse individuals, promoting gender-neutral job descriptions, and
partnering with women-focused organizations and universities. Mentorship and sponsorship programs can help women advance their careers by providing assistance, networking, and access to senior leaders.
Gender diversity requires inclusive workplaces. Diversity and inclusion training can help employees
become more inclusive by raising awareness of unconscious prejudices. Employee resource groups
or affinity networks for women can help women network, support, and share experiences. We can
also emphasize workplace flexibility. Flexible work hours, remote work, and family-friendly policies
might help retain female talent, especially those juggling work and caring.
Finally, we should set gender diversity goals and track progress. Transparency and accountability will
help the company achieve gender diversity goals.

Element 2: Department-average age

IBM HR professionals must examine each department's average age to ensure a diverse and
inclusive workforce. By analyzing the data, we can learn about our teams' ages and find areas for
improvement. IBM's staff includes many seasoned experts of all ages. In the Research and
Development department, the average staff age is 42, reflecting the depth of knowledge and vast
expertise in technical innovation. Design and User Experience departments, on the other hand, have
a younger average age of 31.
From an HR perspective, a good mix of experienced and new hires is crucial. We can use the
strengths of both age groups by encouraging knowledge transfer and mentorship programs, where
older staff can teach younger ones. To attract and retain young talent, engage with universities and
offer internships or entry-level roles. While recognizing and retaining experienced employees,
efforts can be introduced to assist career advancement and retention.
By carefully managing age diversity in each department, we can create a dynamic and creative
atmosphere that benefits from a range of viewpoints, experiences, and ideas. IBM's commitment to
fostering an inclusive workplace where all workers may thrive and contribute to the company's
success includes age diversity.
